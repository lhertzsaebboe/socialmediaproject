# MGT4250 Fall 2023 Course Project
Authors: Jackson Leavitt & Linn Hertz Saebboe, jleavitt@elon.edu & lhertzsaebboe@elon.edu

This is a class project for MGT 4250, Fall 2023, at Elon University. We have chosen to examine various user behaviors and explore how screen time differs among different groups. The questions we decided to focus on were:

- How different age groups vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How different genders vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How does your screen time change depending on relationship status?
- How does your screen time change depending on occupation status?

### Importance
 1. Companies need to understanding user behaviors on social media in order to, for example, help them target individualized ads or use marketing segmentation strategies. Entrepreneurially, this could be an opportunity for a new app or product that might mitigate screen time, encourage productivity, and enhance mental health in this age group.
 2. Identifying students that might be extra recourses. Universities can provide more resources to students, hiring a necessary amount of mental health professionals, and healthily navigating their online coursework.
  
### Data Description 
This dataset was originally collected for a data science and machine learning project aimed at investigating the potential correlation between the amount of time an individual spends on social media and its impact on their mental health. The data was gathered through a survey on a university campus. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the results and findings might be biased due to the demographics of the specific campus. Since the data was collected by a Univesity, the major age group in the dataset is 18-25 year old which is possible to see in the visualizations above.

Section 3 – Interpreting Visualizations 
<img width="585" alt="Skärmavbild 2023-12-06 kl  17 24 57" src="https://github.com/lhertzsaebboe/socialmediaproject/assets/152214822/5e27bee4-e177-4ecc-bc20-f69cb4bd616c">

Age group 21-30 represented most of the answers on the survey. However, for both age group 10-20 and 21-30 the most ferquent answer was "more than 5 hours" for average time spent on social media. For the other age groups, 31-40, 41-50 and 50+, it was more common with less than 3 hours. This shows us how different age groups vary in their social media screen time and phone usage.

Males had a more even spread on their social media screen time. Both female and males had majority over 3 hours of social media screen time but it was more frequent for females to spend more than 5 hours. However, it is important to acknowledge that there were more females that responded to the survey. This shows how different genders vary in their social media screen time and phone usage.

For this visualization purple represents single, pink married, blue represents in a relationship. This visualization shows screen time compared to relationship status. The major takeaways from this graph would be how a majority of single people spend more than 5 hours a day. While less than an hour a day is mostly made up of married couples. While there was more responses of single people it is still possible to see what the majority of the married people answered which was between 1 to 2 hours.

For this visualization you can see the number of hours of screen time based on occupation status. Using the chart and comparing the responses of university students and salaried workers, you can see that university students are mostly more than 5 hours. But the salaried workers are looking at more to 1-2 hours a day.

We decided to add in the mental health data too. However, it is important to note that there is no certain causation but the age group with the most social media screen time also have the most issues with their mental health and sleep issues.


Section 4 – Discussion & Summary 
This response is generated from GPT4:
 Screen time has surged across age groups due to the increasing reliance on phones, laptops, and TVs for work, learning, and entertainment. Children and teens exceed recommended limits, with Gen Z showing a 60-80% increase in phone usage. Millennials are frequent social media users, struggling to stay away from their phones. Gen Z, acknowledging their reliance on screens, favors user-created content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while gaming gains popularity for relaxation. Streaming services face challenges, but many subscribers who initially canceled return within a year, especially in Gen Z. Social media activities vary, with Gen Z and Millennials spending significant time on gaming. TikTok is the most downloaded app globally, followed by Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Overall, increased screen time continues to impact various aspects of daily life and well-being.
 
Does this article relate to our visualizations:
Our visualizations align well with the article and the response from GPT-4 beause we have also seen the increase in phone usage within Gen Z. We also noticed how Millennials have the same issue as Gen Z with not being able to put their phone down. Overall, the article had the same thoughts as us, since phone useage is increasing at an alarming rate among younger generations.
