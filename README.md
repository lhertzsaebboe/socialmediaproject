# socialmediaproject
This is a class project for MGT 4250, Fall 2023, at Elon University. We have chosen to examine various user behaviors and explore how screen time differs among different groups. The questions we decided to focus on were:

- How different age groups vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How different genders vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How does your screen time change depending on relationship status?
- How does your screen time change depending on occupation status?
