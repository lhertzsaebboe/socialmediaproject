# MGT4250 Fall 2023 Course Project
Author: Jackson Leavitt & Linn Hertz Saebboe, jleavitt@elon.edu & lhertzsaebboe@elon.edu

This is a class project for MGT 4250, Fall 2023, at Elon University. We have chosen to examine various user behaviors and explore how screen time differs among different groups. The questions we decided to focus on were:

- How different age groups vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How different genders vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How does your screen time change depending on relationship status?
- How does your screen time change depending on occupation status?

### Importance
 1. Companies need to understanding user behaviors on social media in order to, for example, help them target individualized ads or use marketing segmentation strategies. Entrepreneurially, this could be an opportunity for a new app or product that might mitigate screen time, encourage productivity, and enhance mental health in this age group.
 2. Identifying students that might be extra recourses. Universities can provide more resources to students, hiring a necessary amount of mental health professionals, and healthily navigating their online coursework.
