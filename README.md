# MGT4250 Fall 2023 Course Project
Author: Jackson Leavitt & Linn Hertz Saebboe, jleavitt@elon.edu & lhertzsaebboe@elon.edu

This is a class project for MGT 4250, Fall 2023, at Elon University. We have chosen to examine various user behaviors and explore how screen time differs among different groups. The questions we decided to focus on were:

- How different age groups vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How different genders vary in their screen time and phone usage. 
- How does your screen time change depending on relationship status?
- How does your screen time change depending on occupation status?

### Importance
 1. Companies need to understanding user behaviors on social media in order to, for example, help them target individualized ads or use marketing segmentation strategies. Entrepreneurially, this could be an opportunity for a new app or product that might mitigate screen time, encourage productivity, and enhance mental health in this age group.
 2. Identifying students that might be extra recourses. Universities can provide more resources to students, hiring a necessary amount of mental health professionals, and healthily navigating their online coursework.
  
 
### Data Description 
This dataset was originally collected for a data science and machine learning project aimed at investigating the potential correlation between the amount of time an individual spends on social media and its impact on their mental health. The data was gathered through a survey on a university campus. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the results and findings might be biased due to the demographics of the specific campus. Since the data was collected by a Univesity, the major age group in the dataset is 18-25 year old which is possible to see in the visualizations above. 
We imported the original dataset "smmh.csv" into pyhton and preprocessed the data. We created two different dataframes "larger_df" and "social_media_counts_df.csv" that we imported into Tableau in order to create our visualizations.

Section 3 – Interpreting Visualizations (3 points)
[In your README file] For each visualization, • Great (1 point): Interpret a visualization and explain how it contributes to answering your question • Fair (0.5 points): Interpret a visualization but do not explain how it contributes to answering your question • No or non-subtantial submission 

Section 4 – Discussion & Summary (3 points) [In a README file] • Great (3 points) 

• Find an article related to your questions and summarize the article 
• Ask your questions to GPT-4 and write your query and GPT-4’s responses (You can use the API key for our course; Ask as many as possible for proper responses; Mention that the response is generated from GPT-4) 
• Discuss whether your visualizations align well with the article and GPT-4’s response 
• Fair (2 points): One bullet point for “Great” is not satisfactory • Sub-par (1 point): Two bullet points for “Great” are not satisfactory


Screen time has surged across age groups due to the increasing reliance on phones, laptops, and TVs for work, learning, and entertainment. Children and teens exceed recommended limits, with Gen Z showing a 60-80% increase in phone usage. Millennials are frequent social media users, struggling to stay away from their phones. Gen Z, acknowledging their reliance on screens, favors user-created content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while gaming gains popularity for relaxation. Streaming services face challenges, but many subscribers who initially canceled return within a year, especially in Gen Z. Social media activities vary, with Gen Z and Millennials spending significant time on gaming. TikTok is the most downloaded app globally, followed by Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Overall, increased screen time continues to impact various aspects of daily life and well-being.
